Vimmy-The-Pooh
==============

__When you see someone starting up their Big Vim, you can be pretty sure that an
Adventure is going to happen.__

    Piglet: "Oh Pooh, we will edit text forever, won't we?"

    Vimmy the Pooh: "Even longer"

.

    "When you first wake up in the morning, Pooh," said Piglet at last, "what's the
    first thing you say to yourself?"

    "What to edit?" said Vimmy the Pooh. "What do you say, Piglet?"

    "I say, I wonder what's going to happen exciting today?" said Piglet.

    Pooh nodded thoughtfully.  "It's the same thing," he said.

.

    "Well," said Vimmy the Pooh, "what I like best," and then he had to stop
    and think. Because although Editing Text was a very good thing to do, there
    was a moment just before you began to type which was better than when you
    were, but he didn't know what it was called.

.

    "I wonder what #vim is doing," thought Vimmy the Pooh.
    "I wish I were there to be doing it, too."

.

    "Emacs is clever," said Vimmy the Pooh thoughtfully.

    "Yes," said Piglet, "Emacs is clever."

    "And he has Everything."

    "Yes," said Piglet, "Emacs has Everything."

    There was a long silence.
    "I suppose," said Pooh, "that that's why he never edits anything."

.

    "I did know once, only I've sort of forgotten. I bet :help remembers. I'll
    ask him."

.

    A vimmer, however hard he tries, grows tardy without practice.

.

    Vimmy the Pooh looked at his modes. He knew that one of them was the normal
    mode, and he knew that when you had decided which one of them was normal,
    then the other one was insert, but he never could remember how to begin.

.

    "That's what #vimmers always do," said Vimmy the Pooh, much interested.
    "They call ':help! :help!' and then when you look up, they don't panic."

.

    "Pooh, do you think we could use Vim for editing more types of files?"

    Vimmy the Pooh replied, "I should think so, Piglet."

.

    Piglet fidgeted with his keyboard for a while and then quietly asked,
    "How do I copy your vimrc, Pooh?"

    "You don't," said Vimmy the Pooh, "you create your own."

.

    Some people talk to Vim. Not many listen though. That's the problem.

.

    "He's editing still," said Eeyore gloomily.

    "So he is." Vimmy the Pooh observed politely.

    "And committing."

    "Is he?"

    "Yes," said Eeyore.
    "However," he said, brightening up a little, "we haven't had an issue
    logged lately."

.

    "Oh, :help!" said Vimmy the Pooh. "I'd better find out."
    "Oh, google!" said Pooh. "I shall have to learn more."
    "I don't know!" said Pooh. "Oh, :help and google!"

.

    "How would it be," said Vimmy the Pooh slowly, "if we delete this function
    and try to write a different one?"

    "What's the good of that?" said Rabbit.

    "Well," said Pooh, "we keep looking for a Solution and not finding it, so I
    thought that if we looked for the solution to another problem, we'd be sure
    not to find it, which would be a Good Thing, because then we might find
    something that we weren't looking for, which might be just what we were
    looking for, really."

    "I don't see much sense in that," said Rabbit.

    "No," said Pooh humbly, "there isn't. But there was going to be when I
    began it.  It's just that something happened to it on the way."
