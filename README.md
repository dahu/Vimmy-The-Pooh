Vimmy-The-Pooh
==============

__When you see someone starting up their Big Vim, you can be pretty sure that an
Adventure is going to happen.__

    Piglet: "Oh Pooh, we will edit text forever, won't we?"

    Vimmy the Pooh: "Even longer"

.

    "When you first wake up in the morning, Pooh," said Piglet at last, "what's the
    first thing you say to yourself?"

    "What to edit?" said Vimmy the Pooh. "What do you say, Piglet?"

    "I say, I wonder what's going to happen exciting today?" said Piglet.

    Pooh nodded thoughtfully.  "It's the same thing," he said.

.

    "Well," said Vimmy the Pooh, "what I like best," and then he had to stop
    and think. Because although Editing Text was a very good thing to do, there
    was a moment just before you began to type which was better than when you
    were, but he didn't know what it was called.

.

    "I wonder what #vim is doing," thought Vimmy the Pooh.
    "I wish I were there to be doing it, too."

.

    "Emacs is clever," said Vimmy the Pooh thoughtfully.
    "Yes," said Piglet, "Emacs is clever."
    "And he has Everything."
    "Yes," said Piglet, "Emacs has Everything."
    There was a long silence.
    "I suppose," said Pooh, "that that's why he never edits anything."

.

    "I did know once, only I've sort of forgotten. I bet :help remembers. I'll
    ask him."

.

    A vimmer, however hard he tries, grows tardy without practice.
