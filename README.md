Vimmy-The-Pooh
==============

    Piglet: "Oh Pooh, we will edit text forever, won't we?"

    Vimmy the Pooh: "Even longer"

.

    "When you first wake up in the morning, Pooh," said Piglet at last, "what's the
    first thing you say to yourself?"

    "What to edit?" said Vimmy the Pooh. "What do you say, Piglet?"

    "I say, I wonder what's going to happen exciting today?" said Piglet.

    Pooh nodded thoughtfully.  "It's the same thing," he said.
